Spectacles does not write to the system, thus no setters.

Spectacles gets information from /proc or /sys then creates a YAML object.

The YAML object can them be converted to a Python dictionary, or be parsed by
UNIX type tools, such as sed, awk (or variants), bash, etc.

Many languages have YAML libraries; these libraries may be used to decode the
YAML object into key:value pairs.

Developers may wish to connect to the Spectacles API directly.  The API is
accessible via Spectacles.<module>.API.<class>
ie, "import Spectacles.system.cpu.API.cpu" or  "from Spectacles.system.cpu.API import Cpu"
