xRay is the bare metal reader.  Each type of operating system will have it's own module within it.
ie linux, BSD, Windows

Spex reads system information. It does not write to the system.

Spex gets information from /proc or /sys then creates a Python dict or YAML object.

The YAML object can them be converted to a Python dictionary, or be parsed by
UNIX type tools, such as sed, awk (or variants), bash, etc.

Many languages have YAML libraries; these libraries may be used to decode the
YAML object into key:value pairs.

Developers may wish to connect to the Spex API directly.  The API is
accessible via Spex
ie, "from Spex import Cpu, Ram"
